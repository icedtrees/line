- check if stickers are animated on line
- get custom video stickers and ideas from pusheen twitter and pusheen website
- hook up mobile app? 
- look for todos in code
- handle multiple chat windows correctly


event attempts:
- use messenger.com
- try to use react testutils or enzyme or something to simulate event
- try calling the react component's methods
- try using native textinput event
- try constructing an editor state and call the DraftModifier methods
- try events for paste, text change, drop text, drop image
- try fully copying TextEvent including prototype class
- hijack onclick handler of regular stickers
- try hijacking image upload. mercury message send?


plan:
- see if it's possible to simulate TextEvent
- see if it's possible to simulate ClipboardEvent
- investigate putting image in clipboard or dragging sticker to message window
- fallback to putting url in clipboard
    extras:
    - add placeholder text or notify: should be "paste here and hit enter", or "copied to clipboard!"
    - close sticker window
    - make it work with messenger
    - make it work with multiple chat windows on regular facebook
